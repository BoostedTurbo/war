Your chest pains, with every breath you can feel the dust settling in you lungs. A man runs up to you, he is yelling, but you hear nothing... You only feel a warm sensation running over your ears and onto your neck. The man grabs you and is now yelling at someone else, when he turns back towards you, you see for a split second a glimps of worry. But you can't tell if what you saw was real, he seems collected and in control now. He pushes you down to the ground and is wrapping something red and white around your leg. Your ear gets a uncomfurtable warmth running down it, you brush your ear with you hand and notice it is wet. Panic runs through your vains and you quickly look at your hand... blood... Instantly your thrown back to reality. "Zack stay with me buddy! Look at me! Your going to be okay!" You turn towards the man but cannot distinquish his face, all you see is a simple tattoo of smiley face on the side of his neck. 
As the man looms over you, you notice the sand shooting up from the ground. Most of the time it is just small, but sometimes it will shoot up 10 feet. It reminds you of the 4th of july, playing with black cats and blowing up ant-hills.

Everything goes dark while sand pelts your face. It feels like you have been hit by a truck full of nyquil, all you can think is how nice it would be, to be back in your bed. You close your eyes while the world disapears around you... You can still tell your back on that hill, but to keep your eyes closed and mind absent is the most peaceful you have ever felt. Slowly you feel the deepest sleep crawling upon you. It wants to embrace and take you, and you want the peace it could offer.

"za... stay awa..." "ZACK!...." "MEDIC!" Another slap strikes across your face "DAMNIT ZACK STAY AWAKE! I am not letting you die in this shitty country! You can die back home!"

You open your eyes to see a smiley face greeting you back into reality. Smiling you say "That is the worst tattoo I have ever seen"...
